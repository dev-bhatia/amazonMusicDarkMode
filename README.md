# __Dark Mode on AmazonMusic website__

---

## __About__
### Inspired from many "Dark Mode" UIs, I wanted to create one for the Amazon Music website so my eyes don't hurt when I'm working late at night. So with some CSS magic, here it is!

---

## __Key Goals__
#### `1. Reduce Eye Strain across all pages with a Dark Mode`
#### `2. Increase Readability for easier navigation`
#### `3. Improve Overall Site Appearance`
