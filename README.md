# Dark Mode for Amazon Music
### :wave: Hello! Inspired from many "Dark Mode" UIs, I came across the idea to create one for the Amazon Music website so my eyes don't hurt when I'm working late at night.

### All work is done in the `styles.css` file. As of now, the extension runs on Chrome (not public yet). I came across [this post](https://blog.lateral.io/2016/04/create-chrome-extension-modify-websites-html-css/) leading me to [this repository](https://blog.lateral.io/2016/04/create-chrome-extension-modify-websites-html-css/) when researching how to get started.

# :smiley: Thanks for stopping by!
