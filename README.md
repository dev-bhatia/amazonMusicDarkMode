# :musical_note: Dark Mode for Amazon Music

### Hello! Inspired from many "Dark Mode" UIs, I wanted to create one for the Amazon Music website so my eyes don't hurt when I'm working late at night #EatSleepCodeRepeat

### All work is done in the <b> styles.css </b> file. As of now, the extension runs on Chrome (not public yet). I came across [this post](https://blog.lateral.io/2016/04/create-chrome-extension-modify-websites-html-css/) leading me to [this repository](https://blog.lateral.io/2016/04/create-chrome-extension-modify-websites-html-css/) when researching how to get started

## :smiley: Thanks for stopping by!
