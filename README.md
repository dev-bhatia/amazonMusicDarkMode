# __Reduce Eye Strain on AmazonMusic website__

## __About__
#### Inspired from many "Dark Mode" UIs, I wanted to create one for the Amazon Music website so my eyes don't hurt when I'm working late at night. So with some CSS magic, here it is!


## __Status__

### __TODOs__
- [ ] #### Create Color Variables for CSS
- [ ] #### Organize same elements as one block in CSS

### __Testing__
#### I came across [this post](https://blog.lateral.io/2016/04/create-chrome-extension-modify-websites-html-css/) leading me to [this repository](https://github.com/lateral/chrome-extension-blogpost) when researching how to get started

#### I test my changes on Chrome by uploading the files as Chrome Extension (shown below).

## __Thanks for stopping by!__
