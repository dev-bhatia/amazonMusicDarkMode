# Reduce Eye Strain on AmazonMusic Site :musical_note:

### Hello! Inspired from many "Dark Mode" UIs, I wanted to create one for the Amazon Music website so my eyes don't hurt when I'm working late at night #EatSleepCodeRepeat

### Status: As of now, the extension runs on Chrome (not public yet). 

### I came across [this post](https://blog.lateral.io/2016/04/create-chrome-extension-modify-websites-html-css/) leading me to [this repository](https://github.com/lateral/chrome-extension-blogpost) when researching how to get started

### Thanks for stopping by!
