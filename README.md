# :musical_note: Reduce Eye Strain on AmazonMusic Site

### Hello! Inspired from many "Dark Mode" UIs, I wanted to create one for the Amazon Music website so my eyes don't hurt when I'm working late at night #EatSleepCodeRepeat

### As of now, the extension runs on Chrome (not public yet). I came across [this post](https://blog.lateral.io/2016/04/create-chrome-extension-modify-websites-html-css/) leading me to [this repository](https://github.com/lateral/chrome-extension-blogpost) when researching how to get started

### Known Issues Being Worked On...
- [ ] __Hover Color over Songs in Album View Mode__
- [ ] __Hover Color over Songs in Artist View Mode__
- [ ] __Hover Play Button in Featured Songs Artist View Mode__
- [ ] __Album/Played Checkboxes Disappearing__

### Thanks for stopping by!
