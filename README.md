# __Reduce Eye Strain on AmazonMusic Site :musical_note:__

## __About__
#### Hello! Inspired from many "Dark Mode" UIs, I wanted to create one for the Amazon Music website so my eyes don't hurt when I'm working late at night. I wanted the text to be easier to read and album images to look more modern. So, with some CSS magic, here it is!

#### I came across [this post](https://blog.lateral.io/2016/04/create-chrome-extension-modify-websites-html-css/) leading me to [this repository](https://github.com/lateral/chrome-extension-blogpost) when researching how to get started

## __Preview__
#### For testing, I've been running this as an extension on Chrome (not public).   
#### See the items below for a quick preview!
