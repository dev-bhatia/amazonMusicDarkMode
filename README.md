# __Dark Mode on AmazonMusic website__

### Inspired from many "Dark Mode" UIs, I wanted to create one for the Amazon Music website so my eyes don't hurt when I'm working late at night. So with some CSS magic, here it is!

## __Focus__
#### `1. Reduce Eye Strain across all pages with a Dark Mode`
#### `2. Increase Readability for easier navigation`
#### `3. Improve Overall Site Appearance`

## __Preview__

## __Install__
### This feature is tested & can be used on as an extension on the Google Chrome browser. Check out the video below to see how you too can use this feature!

## __Thanks for stopping by!__
